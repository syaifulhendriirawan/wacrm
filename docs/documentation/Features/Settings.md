# Settings

The **Settings** surface configures your account, your WhatsApp connection, your message templates, your tag library, your deal defaults, how the UI looks, and who's on your team. Seven tabs, URL-routed via `?tab=<name>` so deep links work.

## Tabs

| Tab                 | What it controls                                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Profile**         | Your name, email, password, active sessions.                                                                            |
| **WhatsApp Config** | Phone number, access token, webhook URL.                                                                                |

| **Tags**            | The shared tag library used across Contacts, Inbox, Flows, Automations.                                                 |
| **Deals**           | The account's default deal currency.                                                                                    |
| **Appearance**      | Color theme picker (5 themes).                                                                                          |
| **Members**         | Invite teammates, assign roles, transfer ownership. Full guide: [Members](https://wacrm.tech/docs/members).             |

## Profile

Three sub-sections on this tab.

### Personal info

Edit your **full name** and **email**. Email is read-only after the initial signup — it's tied to your Supabase Auth identity; changing it would require a separate verification flow.

### Password

Three fields: current password, new password, confirm new password. Current is verified server-side via Supabase Auth; the form returns a generic "incorrect password" error rather than distinguishing between "wrong current" and "session expired" to avoid leaking which one it was.

After a successful change you stay signed in on the current session; other active sessions are not revoked. To force log out elsewhere, use the Sessions sub-section below.

### Active sessions

Lists every signed-in browser / device for your account: device fingerprint, last-seen IP (best-effort, can be a proxy address), last-seen time, current-session indicator.

**Log out** revokes that session. The browser holding it gets kicked to `/login` on next interaction. Useful when you log in from a shared computer and forget to log out, or want to nuke a session after a stolen laptop.

## WhatsApp Config

The connection between wacrm and the Meta Cloud API. Without this filled in, nothing sends or receives.

### Fields

- **Phone Number ID** — Meta-assigned. Copy from the Meta for Developers app → WhatsApp → API setup.
- **WhatsApp Business Account ID** — also from the Meta dashboard.
- **Access Token** — masked in the UI (`••••••••`). Click **Edit** to paste a new one, save, done. The token is encrypted at rest via AES-256-GCM ([Architecture](https://wacrm.tech/docs/architecture) has the details).
- **Verify Token** — auto-generated. Used by Meta's webhook handshake.
- **Webhook URL** — auto-generated from your deploy URL. Copy and paste into Meta's webhook config.

### Test connection

The **Test connection** button hits Meta's Graph API to verify the access token + phone number ID actually work. Result chips:

- ✅ **Connected** — Meta accepted the auth; you're ready to send.
- ❌ **Failed** — error tooltip shows Meta's response. Common causes: expired token, wrong phone number ID, app in dev mode hitting a non-allowlisted recipient.

The chip also lives in the page header so you don't have to come back to Settings to check status.

### Token rotation

If you're rotating tokens (Meta forces this every 60-90 days for unverified apps): paste the new token, save, test. Old conversations and templates carry over — only the token is swapped.

For details on **getting** a Meta access token, see [WhatsApp setup](https://wacrm.tech/docs/whatsapp-setup).

## Templates

The **Templates** tab is where you build, submit, edit, and delete WhatsApp message templates — and watch their Meta approval status update in real time. It's grown well past a settings sub-section, so it has its own page:

**→ [Templates](https://wacrm.tech/docs/templates)** — the full guide: the builder (headers, body variables, sample values, buttons), submitting for approval, the status lifecycle, editing and resubmitting, deleting, and real-time webhook status.

Quick orientation:

- **New Template** opens the builder and submits to Meta for approval.
- **Sync from Meta** imports templates created elsewhere and reconciles status if a webhook was missed.
- Only **Approved** templates appear in the [Inbox](https://wacrm.tech/docs/inbox) picker and [Broadcasts](https://wacrm.tech/docs/broadcasts) wizard — drafts and rejects are hidden because Meta refuses them at send time.

## Tags

The shared tag library. Tags are account-scoped (every member of the account sees the same tags) and have:

- **Name** — free-text, unique per tenant.
- **Color** — hex string. Used everywhere the tag renders.

### Creating

**+ New tag** → form with name + colour picker → Save. Appears in the list immediately.

### Editing

Click any tag row → inline edit on name and colour. Saving updates the row, and **every place that tag renders** picks up the new colour on next render — because tags are stored once and joined to contacts via `contact_tags`, not copied per contact.

### Deleting

Confirm → hard-delete. The tag is removed from every contact it was applied to (junction rows go with it). Audit logs that mention the tag survive but render it as a plain string.

### Where tags appear

| Surface         | What tags do there                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Contacts**    | Chips on contact rows + detail view.                                     |
| **Inbox**       | Filter conversations by tag (sidebar).                                   |
| **Broadcasts**  | Audience targeting in step 2.                                            |
| **Flows**       | `condition` node (test for tag presence), `set_tag` node (add / remove). |
| **Automations** | `add_tag` / `remove_tag` steps; `tag_added` trigger.                     |

## Deals

The **Deals** tab sets your account's **default currency** — the one new deals start in and that every aggregated total is shown in. Pick from the dropdown and **Save**.

Where it applies:

- **New deals** default to this currency in the deal form (you can still override per deal).
- **Pipeline-stage totals**, the dashboard **Open Deals Value** card, and the **Pipeline Value** donut format their sums in it.
- **Automation-created deals** (the `create_deal` step) inherit it.

Where it doesn't:

- **Existing deals keep the currency they were saved with.** Changing the default never rewrites past deals.
- Totals are shown in the default currency **without exchange-rate conversion** — wacrm assumes one currency per account. If you track deals in several currencies, stage and dashboard sums add the raw numbers together, so keep a pipeline to a single currency for them to stay meaningful.

### Who can change it

The default currency is an account-wide setting, so it's **admin and owner only** — agents and viewers see the current choice but the control is read-only. (Enforced by row-level security, not just the UI.) See [Members](https://wacrm.tech/docs/members) for the full role matrix.

### Self-hosting note

The setting is stored on the account row (`accounts.default_currency`, added by migration `021`). A fresh install defaults every account to **USD**; change it here once and you're done — no env var or redeploy needed.

## Appearance

5 dark color themes, swap any time. Click a card → applied instantly across the entire app, persisted to this device.

| Theme                | Vibe                                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Violet** (default) | The original — confident, slightly playful.                     |
| **Emerald**          | Growth-coded. Nods at messaging without copying WhatsApp green. |
| **Cobalt**           | Clean B2B-SaaS blue. Calm and product-y.                        |
| **Amber**            | Warm and friendly. Good for SMB teams.                          |
| **Rose**             | Bold and modern. D2C, creator-economy, lifestyle.               |

### How the picker works

Every theme is a block of CSS variables (`--primary`, `--background`, `--sidebar`, etc.) scoped under `html[data-theme="<id>"]`. The picker sets `document.documentElement.dataset.theme` and writes the choice to `localStorage`. An inline boot script in the root layout replays the choice **before React hydrates**, so there's no flash of the default Violet when you reload the page.

### What changes

Across the whole UI: primary buttons, hover states, active nav rows, badges, focus rings, validation chips, dialog highlights. Some semantic colours (success green, warning amber, error red) stay constant regardless of theme — a "Failed" broadcast badge is still red under Emerald.

### Persistence

`localStorage` only. The choice is **device-scoped** — your laptop and your phone can run different themes. There's no account-level sync. (Reasonable trade-off: it's a cosmetic preference, not configuration.)

### Cross-tab sync

If you change the theme in tab A, tab B picks it up via the `storage` event without a refresh.

### Adding a 6th theme

Two-file change: append a new `html[data-theme="<id>"]` block in `src/app/globals.css` (use Violet as the shape reference), and add an entry in `src/lib/themes.ts`. The picker UI, boot script, and provider auto-discover it.

## Limits & notes

- **Team management lives in its own tab.** Inviting teammates, roles, and ownership transfer are handled in the **Members** tab — see the [Members](https://wacrm.tech/docs/members) guide. Invites are link-only (no email delivery).
- **Authentication templates can't be built in-app yet** — create them in Meta WhatsApp Manager and sync. Marketing and Utility templates are fully authored, submitted, and edited in wacrm. See [Templates](https://wacrm.tech/docs/templates).
- **Tag colour palette isn't preset.** Pick any hex. The picker UI has a few swatches as suggestions but accepts arbitrary values.
- **Session list uses Supabase Auth Admin API.** Sessions show as long as Supabase considers them active — typically 1 hour from last refresh.
- **Profile photo upload** isn't wired up in 0.2.0 — the avatar field shows initials. PR welcome.
