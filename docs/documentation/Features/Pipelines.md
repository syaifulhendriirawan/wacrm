# Pipelines

**Pipelines** is the sales side of `wacrm`. A Kanban board of deals moving through stages — drag to reorder, click a card to edit, multiple pipelines if your business splits sales into distinct funnels (e.g. "Wholesale" and "Retail").

## Layout

| Pane | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Top bar** | Pipeline selector dropdown (swap between funnels), **Manage pipelines** entry, **Add deal** button. |
| **Analytics strip** | Quick numbers: total pipeline value, count of deals per stage, won %. |
| **Board** | One column per stage, left-to-right matching the configured order. Deal cards stack inside. |

Each column header is colour-coded per its stage colour (blue, yellow, orange, purple, green — pick what makes sense for your funnel). The "+" in a column header adds a deal directly into that stage.

## The data model

- **Pipelines** — top-level container. A user can have many.
- **Stages** — ordered columns within a pipeline. Each stage has a name, a colour, and a position. A new pipeline seeds five default stages: _New Lead, Qualified, Proposal Sent, Negotiation, Won_. Edit / reorder / delete via **Manage pipelines**.
- **Deals** — the cards. Belong to a pipeline + stage + (optionally) a contact + (optionally) an assignee.

A deal has:

| Field | Use |
| --- | --- |
| **Title** | Short name visible on the card. |
| **Value** | Numeric. New deals default to your account's currency (set in [Settings → Deals](https://wacrm.tech/docs/settings#deals)); override per deal. |
| **Contact** | The customer this deal is about. Nullable — see "Contact deletion" below. |
| **Conversation** | The thread that spawned the deal, when applicable. Useful for one-click jump back to the chat. |
| **Assignee** | The team member responsible. Pick from your tenant's user list. |
| **Expected close date** | Optional forecasting field. |
| **Notes** | Free-form. |
| **Status** | `open` / `won` / `lost`. Independent of stage — see below. |

## Status vs stage

A subtle but important distinction:

- **Stage** = where the deal sits on the board (Proposal Sent, Negotiation, etc.). Drag-drop moves it.
- **Status** = the deal's terminal state (`open`, `won`, `lost`). Set from the deal form. Won/lost deals stay on the board but are visually de-emphasised.

This means a deal can be in the _Proposal Sent_ stage with status `won` — you closed early without dragging through every column. Analytics use **status** for the won-percentage roll-up, not which stage a card is in.

## Working with deals

### Create

- **Add deal** in the top bar → form opens with stage defaulted to the first stage.
- **+** in a column header → form opens with that column pre-picked.
- From the inbox contact sidebar → **\+ Deal** quickly creates a deal with the customer + conversation already attached.

### Edit

Click a card. The deal form opens as a side sheet — edit any field, blur or hit Save. The board updates in real time.

### Move stages

Drag a card from one column to another. The UI updates optimistically; the database UPDATE fires after the drop. If the UPDATE fails the card snaps back and shows a toast.

### Close out

In the deal form, switch **Status** to `won` or `lost`. The card stays where it is but the badge changes; analytics tick over.

### Delete

Kebab on the card → **Delete**. Hard-delete. No archive. (Deleted deals can't be recovered.)

## Multiple pipelines

Useful when your business has truly separate funnels — e.g. **Wholesale** with stages `Discovery → Sample → Quote → Order` sitting alongside **Retail** with stages `Browse → Cart → Checkout → Won`. Each pipeline has its own stage configuration.

**Manage pipelines** opens a panel with the list of existing pipelines:

- **Rename** — inline edit on each row.
- **Reorder stages** — drag stages within a pipeline.
- **Add stage** — pick name + colour + position.
- **Delete stage** — only if no deals reference it. Move them first.
- **Delete pipeline** — only if it's empty.

The pipeline selector in the top bar persists in `localStorage`, so you land back on your last-used pipeline after a refresh.

## Contact deletion behaviour

If a contact gets deleted (or merged) while they have open deals:

- The deal's `contact_id` is set to NULL — the row survives.
- The card renders as **"Unknown contact"** with a dimmed avatar.
- You can re-attach by editing the deal and picking a contact.

This is deliberate (migration 004 changed the FK from CASCADE to SET NULL): revenue history shouldn't disappear because someone hit "delete contact".

## Analytics

The strip above the board shows:

- **Total value** — sum of `value` across all `open` deals in the current pipeline.
- **Deals per stage** — count per column.
- **Won %** — `won / (won + lost)` over the trailing 90 days.

Totals are formatted in your account's **default currency** (set in [Settings → Deals](https://wacrm.tech/docs/settings#deals)) and are **not** converted between currencies — wacrm assumes one currency per account. If a pipeline mixes currencies, the raw `value` numbers are summed as-is, so keep a pipeline to a single currency for the total to be meaningful.

These are computed client-side from the loaded deals — no heavyweight analytics service. For deeper reporting (forecast accuracy, cycle time, cohort win rates), query Supabase directly.

## Limits & notes

- **No per-deal probability or forecast logic.** `value` is the literal user input; the analytics strip doesn't multiply by a probability factor.
- **No deal age / "stuck deal" warnings.** Mentally check the `updated_at` if you want to surface stale ones in SQL.
- **Drag-drop only on desktop.** Touch reorder via long-press is on the v0.3 list.
- **Pipelines are account-scoped via RLS.** Every member of your account sees the same pipelines and deals. Editing the pipeline structure (stages, names) is admin+; moving and editing deals is agent+. Viewers are read-only. See [Members](https://wacrm.tech/docs/members) for the full role matrix.
- **First-visit seed.** Opening Pipelines for the first time creates a default "Sales Pipeline" automatically so you have something to drag onto. Delete and recreate via Manage pipelines if you want a different name.
