# Members

The **Members** surface turns a solo wacrm install into a shared team workspace. Invite teammates by link, give each one a role that controls what they can do, hand off ownership, and remove people when they leave — all from **Settings → Members**.

Under the hood every wacrm install is **account-scoped**: your data belongs to an *account*, not to your user row, and every member of that account works against the same inbox, contacts, pipelines, templates, and flows. A brand-new signup gets a personal account with exactly one member (you, as owner), so if you never invite anyone the app behaves like the single-user CRM it always was.

> Multi-user requires migrations `017` – `020`. If you're self-hosting and upgrading from an earlier version, apply them before deploying — see the [changelog](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for the **migration required** notes. They're idempotent and backfill every existing user as the sole owner of their own account with **no data loss**.

## Roles

Four roles, in a flat privilege ladder. Each one inherits everything the role below it can do.

| Role       | Can do                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**  | Everything. Exactly one per account. Plus the two owner-only powers: **transfer ownership** and delete the account.                                            |
| **Admin**  | Manage members (invite / remove / change roles) and edit account-wide settings — WhatsApp config, templates, pipelines, tags, custom fields, the account name. |
| **Agent**  | Operational work: send messages, create/edit contacts, move deals, run broadcasts, build automations and flows. Cannot touch account settings or members.      |
| **Viewer** | Read-only across the whole app. Sees everything, changes nothing.                                                                                              |

| Manage members (invite, remove, change roles)                                     | —      | —     | ✅     | ✅     |
| Transfer ownership                                                                | —      | —     | —     | ✅     |
| Delete the account                                                                | —      | —     | —     | ✅     |

Per-user settings — your own name, avatar, and password — are always editable regardless of role. They're *yours*, not the account's.

### How roles show up in the app

Roles aren't just a settings-page concept; the rest of the UI respects them. Actions a member can't perform are **shown but disabled**, with a tooltip explaining why, rather than hidden — so the app never feels silently broken to someone looking at a feature they don't have permission for. A viewer sees the inbox composer greyed out; an agent sees the "New template" and "Add pipeline" buttons disabled.

## Inviting a teammate

Invites are **link-only — there's no email delivery.** You generate a share link and send it however you like (Slack, WhatsApp, carrier pigeon). Admin or owner only.

1.  **Settings → Members → Invite member.**
2.  Pick the **role** the invitee will get, an optional **expiry** (in days), and an optional **label** to remind yourself who it's for.
3.  wacrm returns a one-time **share link**. Copy it now — the token is shown **exactly once**. Only a SHA-256 hash is stored on the server, so a leaked database never exposes a usable invite link, but it also means we can't show you the link again. Lost it? Revoke and re-issue.

Outstanding invites appear under **Pending invitations**, where an admin can **revoke** any that haven't been accepted yet.

## Accepting an invite

The recipient opens the link, which lands on a public `/join/<token>` page. Before they commit, the page shows **who's inviting them and into what** — "You're being invited to *Acme Co* as *Agent* " — plus whether the link is still valid (revoked and expired links say so instead).

To accept they need a wacrm login (they sign up or log in first). Redeeming **moves their profile into your account** and cleans up the empty personal account they were assigned at signup.

One guardrail: if the person accepting already has **their own data** in their current account (contacts, conversations, deals, …), redeem is **refused with a clear error** rather than silently abandoning that data. Invites are for bringing fresh teammates onto your account, not for merging two populated accounts.

## Managing members

The members list shows everyone on the account with their role and join date. What's visible depends on *your* role: **admins and owners see email addresses**; agents and viewers see name, avatar, role, and joined date only.

- **Change a role** — admins+ pick a new role from the dropdown next to a member. Note you can't promote someone *to* owner or demote the current owner this way; ownership changes go through transfer (below).
- **Remove a member** — admins+ can remove anyone below them. The removed person **keeps their login** and is moved to a fresh personal account (same as a brand-new signup) — removal revokes their access to *your* account, it doesn't delete their user.

## Transferring ownership

**Owner only.** Every account has exactly one owner, so handing it over is an **atomic swap**: you pick a member, and in one operation they become owner and you drop to admin. Use this before you leave the team, or to move the "buck-stops-here" role to whoever actually runs the account.

## Notes & limits

- **Invites are link-only.** wacrm doesn't send invitation emails — it hands you a link to distribute. This keeps the template zero-config (no transactional-email provider to wire up).
- **One owner at a time.** There's no co-owner concept; use admins for shared management and reserve owner for the single accountable person.
- **Tenancy is enforced in the database, not just the UI.** Every domain table's row-level security checks account membership via a `SECURITY DEFINER` helper, and the member/invite operations run through RPCs that re-check the caller's role server-side. A hidden button is a convenience; the real boundary is in Postgres. See [Architecture](https://wacrm.tech/docs/architecture) for how RLS is wired.
